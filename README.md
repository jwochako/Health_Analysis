# Health Analysis (Kenyan Healthcare Data EDA Project)

## 📌 Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze the state of healthcare in Kenya with a focus on selected diseases. The objective is to understand how counties are performing in addressing key health issues and provide insights to guide the Ministry of Health in decision‑making and resource allocation.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** - for data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** - for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - for visualizations  
- **Jupyter / VS Code** - for development environment  

## 🔧 Data Cleaning Approach
- Removed inaccurate entries and duplicates
- Standardized the `Period` column into proper datetime formatting
- Filled missing data using median imputation per county where relevant
- Maintained transparency where null values remain due to insufficient information

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed
- Disease performance comparison across counties  
- Trend analysis over multiple years  
- Correlation matrix to explore relationships between diseases  
- Visualization of performance using heatmaps, bar charts, and line graphs  

## ✅ Findings Summary
- Significant disparities exist between counties in disease performance
- Some counties show large data gaps → potential reporting challenges
- High null values in *Acute Malnutrition* may indicate poor data collection

## 🔍 Statistical Insights
- Weak correlations between some diseases suggest independent outbreak factors
- Stronger relationships found between vaccination metrics and disease reduction
- Outliers identified - focus needed in underperforming counties

## 📌 Recommendations
- Strengthen health reporting systems in counties with large missing gaps
- Allocate more resources to counties with higher disease prevalence
- Enhance vaccination programs where performance shows direct disease reduction
- Introduce continuous monitoring dashboards for county health performance
